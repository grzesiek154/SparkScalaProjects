"type"
Yes, the type alias FunctorType is just a shorthand for

(LocalDate, HolidayCalendar, Int, Boolean) => LocalDate

Type aliases are often used to keep the rest of the code simple: you can now write

def doSomeThing(f: FunctorType)

which will be interpreted by the compiler as

def doSomeThing(f: (LocalDate, HolidayCalendar, Int, Boolean) => LocalDate)
