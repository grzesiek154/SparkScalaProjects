  //  Sometimes there is a need to perform multiple aggregations per group at the same time.
  //For example, in addition to the count, you also would like to know the minimum and
  //maximum values. The RelationalGroupedDataset class provides a powerful function
  //called agg that takes one or more column expressions, which means you can use any of
  //the aggregation functions including the ones listed in Table 5-1. One cool thing is these
  //aggregation functions return an instance of the Column class so you can then apply any
  //of the column expressions using the provided functions. A common need is to rename
  //the column after the aggregation is done to make it shorter, more readable, and easier to
  //refer to.

//    By default the aggregation column name is the aggregation expression, which makes
//the column name a bit long and not easy to refer to. A common pattern is to use the
//Column.as function to rename the column to something more suitable.
//The versatile agg function provides an additional way to express the column
//expressions via a string-based key-value map. The key is the column name, and the value
//is an aggregation function, which can be avg, max, min, sum, or count.

//    The result is the same as in Listing 5-14. Notice there isnâ€™t an easy way to rename the
//aggregation result column name. One advantage this approach has over the first one is the
//map can programmatically be generated. When writing production ETL jobs or performing
//exploratory analysis, the first approach is used more often than the second one.
