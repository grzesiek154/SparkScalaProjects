//  Understanding closures
//
//One of the harder things about Spark is understanding the scope and life cycle of variables and methods when executing code across a cluster. RDD operations that modify variables outside of their scope can be a frequent source of confusion. In the example below we’ll look at code that uses foreach() to increment a counter, but similar issues can occur for other operations as well.
//Example
//
//Consider the naive RDD element sum below, which may behave differently depending on whether execution is happening within the same JVM. A common example of this is when running Spark in local mode (--master = local[n]) versus deploying a Spark application to a cluster (e.g. via spark-submit to YARN):
  
  val sc = new SparkContext("local[*]", "Closures")
  
  var counter = 0
  
  
  val data = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  var rdd = sc.parallelize(data)
  
  
  // Wrong: Don't do this!!
rdd.foreach(x => counter += x)

println("Counter value: " + counter)

//The behavior of the above code is undefined, and may not work as intended. To execute jobs, Spark breaks up the processing of RDD operations into tasks, each of which is executed by an executor. Prior to execution, Spark computes the task’s closure. The closure is those variables and methods which must be visible for the executor to perform its computations on the RDD (in this case foreach()). This closure is serialized and sent to each executor.
//
//The variables within the closure sent to each executor are now copies and thus, when counter is referenced within the foreach function, it’s no longer the counter on the driver node. There is still a counter in the memory of the driver node but this is no longer visible to the executors! The executors only see the copy from the serialized closure. Thus, the final value of counter will still be zero since all operations on counter were referencing the value within the serialized closure.
//
//In local mode, in some circumstances, the foreach function will actually execute within the same JVM as the driver and will reference the same original counter, and may actually update it.
//
//To ensure well-defined behavior in these sorts of scenarios one should use an Accumulator. Accumulators in Spark are used specifically to provide a mechanism for safely updating a variable when execution is split up across worker nodes in a cluster. The Accumulators section of this guide discusses these in more detail.
//
//In general, closures - constructs like loops or locally defined methods, should not be used to mutate some global state. Spark does not define or guarantee the behavior of mutations to objects referenced from outside of closures. Some code that does this may work in local mode, but that’s just by accident and such code will not behave as expected in distributed mode. Use an Accumulator instead if some global aggregation is needed.
