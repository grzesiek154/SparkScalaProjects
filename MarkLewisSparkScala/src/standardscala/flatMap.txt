similar to map(func), the func should return a
collection rather than a single element, and this method
will flatten out the returned collection. this allows an input
item to map to zero or more output items

When to use flatMap:

- Youâ€™re using map (or a for/yield expression) to create a new collection from an
existing collection.
- The resulting collection is a list of lists.
- You call flatten immediately after map (or a for/yield expression)
