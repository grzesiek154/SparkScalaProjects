**NumPy**
This library, whose name means numerical Python, constitutes the core of many other
Python libraries that have originated from it. Indeed, NumPy is the foundation library
for scientific computing in Python since it provides data structures and high-performing
functions that the basic package of the Python cannot provide. In fact, as you will see
later in the book, NumPy defines a specific data structure that is an N-dimensional array
defined as ndarray.
Knowledge of this library is essential in terms of numerical calculations since its
correct use can greatly influence the performance of your computations. Throughout
the book, this library is almost omnipresent because of its unique characteristics, so an
entire chapter is devoted to it (Chapter 3).
This package provides some features that will be added to the standard Python:

• Ndarray: A multidimensional array much faster and more efficient
than those provided by the basic package of Python.

• Element-wise computation: A set of functions for performing this type
of calculation with arrays and mathematical operations between
arrays.

• Reading-writing datasets: A set of tools for reading and writing data
stored in the hard disk.

• Integration with other languages such as C, C++, and FORTRAN: A
set of tools to integrate code developed with these programming
languages.
